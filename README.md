# Laikago CAD Model
This cad models can be used by physics engines like [Pybullet](https://github.com/erwincoumans/pybullet_robots).

## STL format:
### Instructions:
* The four hips are different, but you can get all four hips from only one hip by rotating it. `hip` means left-front hip.
* The left and right thigh are different. `thigh` means left thigh, and `thigh_mirror` means right thigh.
* The four calfs are all the same.
* You can find the kinematics and dynamics parameters in "[laikago_ros/laikago_description](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/laikago_ros)" folder.
